As Form Teachers play a central role in shaping the development of their young charges, the Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP) has been introduced in all primary schools since 2012.

The objectives of FTGP are to: 

*    provide quality interaction time between form teachers and students, and
*    equip students with social and emotional competencies.

In ATS, the weekly FTGP lessons carve out time for more quality teacher-student interaction and allow teachers to equip students with social and emotional competencies. 

Social and Emotional Competencies (SEC) are explicitly taught during FTGP. Form Teachers conduct explicit teaching of Social and Emotional competencies to equip students with self-awareness, social awareness, self-management, relationship management and responsible decision making skills. In addition, both Form Teachers per class bond with students through interaction activities within the period. They also take turns to conduct One-to-One Sharing sessions with their students aiming to build quality teacher-student-relationships through gaining in-depth knowledge of their students. This would help teachers to guide and support them in the areas that were surfaced during the sessions. 

  
Mandatory lessons on Cyber Wellness, Education and Career Guidance (ECG) have been incorporated in FTGP lessons to address specific issues, reinforce the core values and social and emotional competencies to enable students to apply them to the specific contexts.
