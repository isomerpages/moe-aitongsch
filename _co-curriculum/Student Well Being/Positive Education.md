In Ai Tong School, we believe in providing holistic learning experiences that encompass joyful learning, character building as well as equipping students with tools to promote well- being.

We aim to nurture our students to have confidence in themselves, to possess a positive attitude towards learning and to be able to persevere when faced with challenges. To accomplish this goal, Ai Tong School sets to introduce Positive Education, a refreshing way, inspired by research-based practices in the field of Positive Psychology to support the development of student well-being. For a start, students are introduced to two key topics: Gratitude and Growth Mindset.

### Gratitude

Students learn about being thankful, the need to show appreciation and ways to return kindness. We aim to allow students to practise Gratitude and allow them to reflect on how a simple deed in doing good towards others can make them feel good about themselves and improve relationships.

### Growth Mindset
Students learn about growing their brain muscles and realize the possibilities of growth in learning with practices.
Discovering the power of ‘Yet’ will challenge students’ perception of learning and achievements and empower them with a positive outlook towards learning. Goal setting is also a powerful way of using growth mindset to overcome challenges.
