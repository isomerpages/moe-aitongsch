**<u>Chinese Dance</u>**

Since the 1950s, Chinese Dance has been a mainstay of the performing arts at Ai Tong. It not only passes on dance skills but reinforces Chinese culture as well.  In addition, students get to appreciate dance as a performing art and develop greater self-discipline and perseverance. Other than Chinese Dance, we also expose our students to International dance with contemporary element where they develop rhythm and grace.

  

Members will get to take part in the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF). They will also be given opportunities to put up performances for their fellow schoolmates during assembly.

**<u>International Dance</u>**

Our International Dance troupe is gaining prominence in our performing arts. Our girls once again bagged a Gold award in 2012. In their performance, "Silky Radiance", the girls are "silkworms" wearing silvery costumes.

 The dance of metamorphosis depicts a transformation from pupae into beautiful butterflies. The gracefulness and delicacy of the butterfly is transmitted by our students' youthful gentleness in the dance. Flutter away, little butterflies!
