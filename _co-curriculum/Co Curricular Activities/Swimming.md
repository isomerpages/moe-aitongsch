Swimming has often been described as one of the best sports to maintain a healthy body. This is because it is a whole body workout. Swimming is an endurance sport, and as such an excellent cardiovascular exercise. Besides the health and fitness benefits, learning to swim also equips our students with an essential survival skill. Swimming helps to inculcate intrinsic qualities such as honour, courage and determination in the students.  

  

The Swimming CCA is open to Primary 3 to Primary 6 students who have at least a Bronze certification in swimming proficiency. Training is twice a week on Tuesdays and Thursdays at the Bishan Swimming Complex.

  

Students who meet the minimum qualifying times will be selected to represent the school at the National Primary Schools Swimming Championships.
