<p>Students learn about the 24 Festive Drums. It is a traditional performance
art incorporating a series of Chinese art - Chinese drum, calligraphy,
traditional dance &amp; martial art. Students will also learn the drumming
techniques for the Chinese drum and music theory to develop their sense
of rhythm. Platforms will be provided for students to showcase what they
have learnt during performances.</p>
<p>In line with our schoolâ€™s vision of nurturing students of good character
rooted in Chinese Culture, Percussion CCA is one platform that provides
the opportunities for students to learn more about the Chinese culture
and widen their horizon of music appreciation in a fun and engaging manner.
It is not only a performing group; it is also a CCA group that emphasizes
a lot on discipline, character building, teamwork as well as inculcating
positive learning attitudes.</p>
