In line with our schoolâ€™s vision of nurturing students of good character rooted in Chinese Culture, Percussion CCA is one platform that provides the opportunities for students to learn more about the Chinese culture and widen their horizon of music appreciation in a fun and engaging manner. It is not only a performing group; it is also a CCA group that emphasizes a lot on discipline, character building, teamwork as well as positive learning attitude.
