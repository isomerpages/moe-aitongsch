<p><strong>Synopsis:</strong>
</p>
<p>Students learn about the 24 Festive Drums, a traditional performance art
incorporating a series of Chinese art - Chinese drum, calligraphy, traditional
dance &amp; martial art. Students will learn the drumming techniques for
the Chinese drum and music theory to develop their sense of rhythm. Performance
platforms are provided for students to showcase what they have learnt.</p>
<p>In line with our school’s vision of nurturing students of good character
rooted in Chinese Culture, Percussion CCA is one platform that provides
the opportunities for students to learn more about the Chinese culture
and widen their horizon of music appreciation in a fun and engaging manner.
It is not simply a performing group; it is a CCA group that emphasizes
a lot on discipline, character building, teamwork as well as inculcating
positive learning attitudes.</p>
