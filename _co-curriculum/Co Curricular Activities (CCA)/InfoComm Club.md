<p><strong>Synopsis:&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>MINECRAFT EDUCATION &amp; MAKECODE ARCADE WORKSHOP</strong>
</p>
<p>The Microsoft Game Development will help students gain an understanding
of what game development is, different types of digital games and how to
use MS Minecraft Education and MS Makecode Arcade to code and create those
games.</p>
<p>For the Minecraft Education segment, students will learn Minecraft design
principles and how to code and create an openworld Minecraft game with
game characters, NPCs that they can play individually or collaboratively.</p>
<p>For the Makecode Arcade segment, students will learn different game mechanics,
how to create their own sprites and 2D retro-arcade games such as Space
Invaders and Flappy Bird. More importantly, these platforms are free for
students to continue using and practicing at home after the workshops.
This enables students to continue their game development journey after
successful conclusion of the workshop.</p>
