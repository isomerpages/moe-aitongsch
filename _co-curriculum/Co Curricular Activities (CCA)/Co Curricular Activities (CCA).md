Our CCA programme provides students with a platform to discover their interests and talents. We aim to fuel in the individual a lifelong love for a particular activity. This will help the individual to lead a balanced life even after they have graduated.</p><p>All CCAs emphasise social interaction by providing a common space for friendships and social integration amongst students of diverse backgrounds. Students develop a sense of identity and belonging to the school while getting involved in their respective CCAs. Students progressively develop CCA-specific knowledge, skills, values and attitudes through sustained participation in their CCAs. Core values, social and emotional competencies and the emerging 21st century competencies are also integrated into CCAs.</p><p>The four broad categories of CCAs that are offered are Physical Sports, Visual and Performing Arts, Clubs and Societies and Uniformed Groups. In total, 21 CCAs are offered.</p><p><strong><u>Physical Sports</u></strong><br>Physical Sports develop robustness, fair play and team spirit in students. Through the CCA sessions, the students will demonstrate such desirable social qualities and acquire skills that allow them to play at social level with their peers.</p><p><strong><u>Clubs &amp; Societies</u></strong><br>Clubs and Societies allow students to explore and extend their interests in wide ranging and specialised areas which may be knowledge-based or skills-based. Students hone information, communication and technical skills as they strive to grow in their mastery of specialised areas.</p><p><strong><u>Uniformed Groups</u></strong><br>Uniformed Group activities aim to make good citizens of students by inculcating in them self-reliance, resilience, discipline and a spirit of service to others.</p><p><strong><u>Visual and Performing Arts</u></strong><br>Aesthetics instill in students a sense of graciousness and an appreciation for the rich culture and heritage of a multi-racial society.</p><h3>Change of CCA</h3><p>Students are strongly encouraged to remain in their CCA throughout their primary school journey. This is to provide opportunity for progression and to hone values such as resilience and perseverance. Students who require a withdrawal and/or change in CCA due to valid reasons may only opt for a change of CCA at the beginning of each academic year (January).</p><p>Students have to submit the Withdrawal Form to the CCA Teacher-in-charge. Parents/Guardians to fill up the form accordingly with the reason(s) clearly stated. Students will remain in the current CCA until the Transfer/Withdrawal has been approved.</p><p>Changing of CCAs for Primary 5 (after January) and Primary 6 is not permitted (case by case basis).</p><p>The enrolment to a new CCA is pending vacancy in that CCA. Students are entitled to only ONE CCA change during the time you are in the school.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://go.gov.sg/aitong-cca-request-form-2022" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">CCA Request Form.docx</a></p><h3>CCA FAQs</h3><p><a href="/files/CCA%20FAQs.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">CCA FAQs.pdf</a></p>
