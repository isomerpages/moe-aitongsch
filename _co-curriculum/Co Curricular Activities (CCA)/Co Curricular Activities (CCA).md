<p>CCAs are an integral part of our studentsâ€™ holistic education and development.
Our CCA programme provides students with a platform to discover their interests
and talents. We aim to fuel in the individual a lifelong love for a particular
activity. This will help the individual to lead a balanced life even after
they have graduated.</p>
<p>All CCAs emphasise social interaction by providing a common space for
friendships and social integration amongst students of diverse backgrounds.
Students develop a sense of identity and belonging to the school while
getting involved in their respective CCAs. Students progressively develop
CCA-specific knowledge, skills, values and attitudes through sustained
participation in their CCAs. Core values, social and emotional competencies
and the emerging 21st century competencies are also integrated into CCAs.</p>
<p>The four broad categories of CCAs that are offered are Physical Sports,
Visual and Performing Arts, Clubs and Societies and Uniformed Groups. In
total, 18 CCAs are offered.</p>
<p><strong><u>Physical Sports</u></strong>
<br>Physical Sports develop robustness, fair play and team spirit in students.
Through the CCA sessions, the students will demonstrate such desirable
social qualities and acquire skills that allow them to play at social level
with their peers.</p>
<p><strong><u>Clubs &amp; Societies</u></strong>
<br>Clubs and Societies allow students to explore and extend their interests
in wide ranging and specialised areas which may be knowledge-based or skills-based.
Students hone information, communication and technical skills as they strive
to grow in their mastery of specialised areas.</p>
<p><strong><u>Uniformed Groups</u></strong>
<br>Uniformed Group activities aim to make good citizens of students by inculcating
in them self-reliance, resilience, discipline and a spirit of service to
others.</p>
<p><strong><u>Visual and Performing Arts</u></strong>
<br>Aesthetics instill in students a sense of graciousness and an appreciation
for the rich culture and heritage of a multi-racial society.</p>
