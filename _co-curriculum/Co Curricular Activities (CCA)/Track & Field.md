<p><strong>Synopsis:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The CCA emphasises on character building through our activities. Athletes will develop grit and resilience in addition to crucial life-skills required in their lives beyond the CCA and primary school years.&nbsp;</p><p>Athletes are taught techniques across a spectrum of track and field events in a safe manner. They are taught sprinting, running, hurdling, throwing and jumping with skills enhancement in specific events. Athletes are given opportunities to participate in competitions based on their performance during training. More importantly, they develop all-round physical fitness which contributes to an active and healthy lifestyle.</p><table><tbody><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Day&nbsp; and Time</p></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Teachers- in-Charge</p></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Venue</p></th></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>*Tuesdays: 2pm - 4.30pm</strong><br>(P4, P5, P6)</p><p><strong>*Thursdays: 2pm - 4.30pm</strong><br>(P3)</p><p>School Team trains on both days</p><p><br></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Mr Jay Sng (Main i/c)</p><p>Miss Cheryl Cheng (2 i/c)</p><p>Mrs Estee Goh</p><p>Mr Charles Ng</p><p>Mr Clement Chan</p><p>Ms Michele Fok</p><p><br></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>External Venue:&nbsp;<br>Bishan/ Yio Chu Kang Stadium (parents may pick child from stadium at 4pm)</p><p><br></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>* Dismissal from ATS is 4.30pm and hence there is no school bus service back home from school after training.</p><p><br><br></p>
