<p><strong>Synopsis:&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>The CCA emphasises on character building through our activities. Athletes
will develop grit and resilience in addition to crucial life-skills required
in their lives beyond the CCA and primary school years.</p>
<p>Athletes are taught techniques across a spectrum of track and field events
in a safe manner. They are taught sprinting, running, hurdling, throwing
and jumping with skills enhancement in specific events. Athletes are given
opportunities to participate in competitions based on their performance
during training. More importantly, they develop all-round physical fitness
which contributes to an active and healthy lifestyle.</p>

back home from school after training.
