<p><strong>Synopsis:</strong>
</p>
<p>Brandishing sabres, twirling swords, swirling motion! This is Wushu. The
team (derived from "wu (武)" - military and "shu (术)" - art) means the art
of fighting or martial arts. Speed, difficulty and presentation distinguish
Wushu's fluid moves, martial arts patterns and manoeuvres (kicks, punches
and jumps), building resilience and perseverance during training.</p>
<p>Our Wushu members benefit in fitness, confidence and skills from their
training with different weapons and various barehand techniques. Each has
at least one specialization.</p>
<p>Wushu is an ideal CCA for students who are active physically and socially
and want to know more about Chinese Martial Arts. Members are trained in
these events – Quan, Sword, Sabre, Cudgel, Spear etc.</p>
