<p><strong>Synopsis:</strong></p><p>Art Club expands students' artistic horizons, exploring ceramics, printmaking, and various painting techniques like acrylics, watercolors, and Chinese ink. Guided through drawing, painting, and sculpting techniques, members develop creative and critical thinking. They create artworks infused with imagination and personal experiences. Participation in art competitions and exhibitions is a key feature. Beyond art, we instill values of respect, perseverance, and resilience as students work independently and collaboratively. The Art Club is a dynamic platform fostering well-rounded individuals with a passion for art, honing technical skills, and nurturing character development.</p><table><tbody><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Day&nbsp; and Time</p></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Teachers- in-Charge</p></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Venue</p></th></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Tuesdays - P3 and P4</strong><br>2pm to 4pm</p><p><strong>Thursdays - P5 and P6</strong></p><p>2pm to 4pm</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>*Mrs Eileen Peh</p><p>*Mrs Grace Chua&nbsp;</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Art Room 1, 2 and 3</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>* Teacher-in-Charge</p><p><br><br></p>
