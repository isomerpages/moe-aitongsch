<p><strong>Synopsis:&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>Sports Club is a CCA that develops students’ character, resilience and
teamwork through physical activity. Each term, students will be exposed
to a variety of sports and games to build fundamental movement skills,
coordination and fitness in a fun and supportive environment. Through practising
skills, cooperating with others and learning to persevere, students grow
in confidence and develop healthy habits. We look forward to your child’s
active participation and enjoyment in Sports Club.</p>
