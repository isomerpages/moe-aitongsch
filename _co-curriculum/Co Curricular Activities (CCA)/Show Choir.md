<p>Show Choir is a dynamic performance group that combines choral singing
with dance choreography. It differs from traditional choir with the inclusion
of choreographed dance routines and creative costumes in their performance.
In Ai Tong School, we are most thankful that we have the opportunity to
allow our choir students experiences that are enriching and meaningful
as they journey with us.</p>
<p>Ai Tong Show Choir aims to cultivate a love for music, an appreciation
for the art of singing with synchronized dance moves in our students. Vocal
production and projection techniques are taught to our students, alongside
basic sight-signing, listening, aural and dance skills.</p>
<p>Ai Tong Show Choir consists of Primary 3 to Primary 5 students. A high
level of commitment and teamwork is required of the members, who practice
twice weekly to hone their skills in choral and dance.</p>
<p>Besides taking part in the biennial Singapore Youth Arts Presentation,
the choir also performs for school events such as festive celebrations,
National Day celebration and Teachers’ Day celebrations..</p>
<p>Sing on, sing on, Ai Tong Show Choir! We’ve got rhythm!</p>
