<p><strong>Synopsis:</strong>
</p>
<p>Ai Tong School show choir is formed with the aim of cultivating a love
for music, an appreciation for the art of singing with synchronized dance
moves in the members. Vocal production techniques, basic sight-singing,
listening, aural and complementary dance moves are some of the skills imparted
to equip our young singers to perform well. The show choir is made up of
Primary 3 to 6 members. High level of commitment and teamwork is demanded
of the members who meet weekly to practise and improve their skills in
singing songs of various genres. Besides taking part in the biennial Singapore
Youth Festival and Central Judging (Choir), the choir also performs for
the Prize Giving Ceremony, Teachers’ Day Concert, Children’s Day Concert
and other ad-hoc concerts. Sing on, sing on! We’ve got rhythm!</p>
