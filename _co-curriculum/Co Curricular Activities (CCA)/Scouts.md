<p><strong>Synopsis:</strong>
</p>
<p>Scouting has a purpose which is to help young people to develop their
full physical, intellectual, emotional, social and spiritual capacities
as individuals and as members of society, and thus contribute to the development
of a better world. Cub Scouts activities include skills training such as
knot-tying and basic first-aid. In addition, we have pack games, inter-Six
games, sense-training games, relays and other games to promote social bonding
amongst our boys. Stories, in particular Kiplingâ€™s Jungle Book and other
similar stories that involve adventure, romance, humour, history, religious
stories etc., are used and help each Cub Scout to more easily understand
the meaning of their Promise and Law through analogy, stories and plays</p>
