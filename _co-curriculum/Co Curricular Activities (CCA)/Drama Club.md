<p><strong>Synopsis:</strong>
</p>
<p>The Bilingual Drama CCA is the perfect place for students who love to
perform, create, and have fun with stories! Through exciting activities
like improvisation games, choral reading, and theatre sports, members learn
to express themselves confidently in both languages. They’ll explore how
to use their voices, faces, and movements to bring characters to life while
building teamwork and imagination. Best of all, members will get the chance
to shine on stage and perform for their schoolmates — celebrating creativity,
friendship, and the joy of drama!</p>
