<p><strong>Synopsis:</strong>
</p>
<p>The Bilingual Drama Club is an excellent choice of CCA for students who
aspire to express themselves artistically through drama. Our aim is to
nurture members to be passionate and committed cultural enthusiasts. They
will be trained in drama techniques like forming tableaux, improvisation,
choral reading, theatre sports, exploring the use of body movements and
voice projection.Members will be given opportunities to put up performances
for their fellow schoolmates.</p>
