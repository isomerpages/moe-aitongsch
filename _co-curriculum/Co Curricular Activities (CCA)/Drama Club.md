<p><strong>Synopsis:</strong></p><p>The Bilingual Drama Club is an excellent choice of CCA for students who aspire to express themselves artistically through drama. Our aim is to nurture members to be passionate and committed cultural enthusiasts. They will be trained in drama techniques like forming tableaux, improvisation, choral reading, theatre sports, exploring the use of body movements and voice projection.Members will be given opportunities to put up performances for their fellow schoolmates.</p><table><tbody><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Day&nbsp; and Time</p></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Teachers In-Charge</p></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Venue</p></th></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Tuesday and Thursday</strong></p><p>2:15pm to 4:00pm</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>*Mdm Wu Mei Hui</p><p>*Mdm Fan Xiao Xia</p><p>Mr Tan Chin Kiang</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Music Room A41 &amp; F41</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>* Main Teacher In-Charge</p><p><br><br><br></p>
