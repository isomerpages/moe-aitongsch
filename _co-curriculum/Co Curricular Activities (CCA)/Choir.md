<p><strong>Synopsis:</strong>
</p>
<p>Ai Tong School show choir is formed with the aim of cultivating a love
for music, an appreciation for the art of singing with synchronized dance
moves in the members. Vocal production techniques, basic sight-singing,
listening, aural and complementary dance moves are some of the skills imparted
to equip our young singers to perform well. High level of commitment and
teamwork is demanded of the members who meet weekly to practise and improve
their skills in singing songs of various genres. Besides taking part in
the biennial Singapore Youth Festival and Central Judging (Choir), the
choir also performs for the Prize Giving Ceremony, Teachers’ Day Concert,
Children’s Day Concert and other ad-hoc concerts.</p>
