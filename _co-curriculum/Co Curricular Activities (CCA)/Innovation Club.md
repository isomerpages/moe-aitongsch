<p>The Innovation Club CCA creates a platform for students to discover the world around them, be marveled by their own creativity and unleash their potential for innovation. There will be myriad opportunities for the students to be engaged in self-directed and cooperative learning. Students will also get to explore creative problem-solving approaches which help in broadening their imaginative space. The Innovation Club is ideal for inquisitive students looking beyond the horizon and aiming to harness their creativity to fuel the changes around them.</p><table><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Day</strong></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Time</strong></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Teachers-in-charge</strong></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Venue</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2" colspan="1"><p>Thursday<br>P3 to P6</p></td><td rowspan="2" colspan="1"><p>2.15pm to 4pm</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>*Mrs Cheng Tai Yeng</p></td><td rowspan="2" colspan="1"><p>Playscape Room</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>*Ms Jessie Lee</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>*Teacher-in-Charge</p>
