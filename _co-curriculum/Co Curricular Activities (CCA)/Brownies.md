<p>Brownies is a CCA that emphasizes on the development of primary school girls. It sets out to help the Brownie achieve her fullest potential, relate to others, develop the right values to guide her actions, provide a sound foundation for her decision-making, and contribute to the improvement of society. Through our Brownies CCA, we hope to equip our Brownies with life skills and inspire them to think about what they want to be and do in the future.</p><table><tbody><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Day&nbsp; and Time</p></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Teachers- in-Charge</p></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Venue</p></th></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Thursdays</strong><br>2.15 pm to 4.00 pm</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>* Mrs Geraldine Tay<br>* Ms Asrini<br>Mdm Sharon Tan</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Rooms F31, F32</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>* Teacher-in-Charge</p><p></p>
