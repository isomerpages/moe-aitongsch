<p><strong>Synopsis:</strong>
</p>
<p>Badminton is one of the most effective sports to burn calories. Players
have to be swift and have good hand-to-eye coordination. Regular playing
can strengthen forearm and leg muscles and bones. The sport is also proven
to reduce stress and increase heart health and metabolism rate. Our coaches
and teachers emphasize on team work, resilience and sportsmanship. We aim
to maximise our playersâ€™ potential and give them opportunities to show
their leadership qualities. Players are expected to put in consistent effort
during training and be receptive to feedback in order to improve their
skills.</p>
