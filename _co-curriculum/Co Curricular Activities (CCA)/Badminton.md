<p>Badminton is a fast paced sport which requires the player to be alert and agile. Besides teaching our students the skills and strategies required to play the game well, Ai Tong Badminton also hopes to instill&nbsp;character building in our students through the sport. Students learn patience through turn-taking; perseverance and teamwork through friendly matches and in inter-school competitions.</p><table><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Day</strong></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Time</strong></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Teachers-in-charge</strong></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Venue</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="4" colspan="1"><p>Monday<br>P3 &amp; P4 (R)<br><br>Tuesday<br>P3 (C) to P6 (C) + P6 (R)<br><br>Thursday<br>P4 (C) to P6 (C) + P5 (R) <br></p></td><td rowspan="4" colspan="1"><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>2.15pm to 4pm</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>*Mdm Kun Swee Bin</p></td><td rowspan="4" colspan="1"><p>ISH</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>*Mdm Revathi</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Ms Jessica Puay</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Mdm Tan Wee Bee</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>(R) denotes Recreation Team<br>(C) denotes Competitive Team<br>(B) denotes Boys Team<br>(G) denotes Girls Team<br>* Teacher-in-Charge</p>
