<p><strong>Synopsis:</strong></p><p>Badminton is one of the most effective sports to burn calories. Players have to be swift and have good hand-to-eye coordination. Regular playing can strengthen forearm and leg muscles and bones. The sport is also proven to reduce stress and increase heart health and metabolaism rate. Our coaches and teachers emphasize on team work, resilience and sportsmanship. We aim to maximise our players’ potential and give them opportunities to show their leadership qualities. Players are expected to put in consistent effort during training and be receptive to feedback in order to improve their skills.</p><p></p><table><tbody><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Day and Time</p></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Teachers- in-Charge</p></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Venue</strong></p></th></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Monday (P3 &amp; P4 – P6)</strong><br>2:15pm to 4pm</p><p><strong>Tuesday (P4 – P6)</strong><br>2:15pm to 4pm</p><p><strong>Thursday (P4 – P6)</strong><br>2:15pm to 4pm</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Mdm Kun Swee Bin</p><p>Ms Revathi</p><p>Mdm Tan Wee Bee</p><p>Ms Jessica Puay</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Indoor Sports Hall (ISH)</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>(C) denotes Competitive Team<br>(B) denotes Boys Team<br>(G) denotes Girls Team<br>* Teacher-in-Charge</p><p></p>
