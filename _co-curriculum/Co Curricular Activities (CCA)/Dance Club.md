<p><strong>Synopsis:</strong>
</p>
<p>Dance Club in Ai Tong School passionately nurtures the diverse dance interests
of its members while celebrating the unique talents of each individual.
We aim to teach our students integral dance skills while developing their
self-discipline and perseverance. In addition, students learn to appreciate
dance as an art form. In Ai Tong School, we also expose our students to
different dance genres such as Chinese Dance, which reinforces their love
for the chinese culture, and International dance with contemporary elements
which further develops their rhythm and grace.</p>
<p>Members will get to take part in the Biennial Singapore Youth Festival
(SYF). They will also be given opportunities to perform for their fellow
schoolmates during various school events.</p>
