<p><strong>Synopsis:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Since the 1950s, Chinese Dance has been a mainstay of the performing arts at Ai Tong. It not only passes on dance skills but reinforces Chinese culture as well.&nbsp; In addition, students get to appreciate dance as a performing art and develop greater self-discipline and perseverance. Other than Chinese Dance, we also expose our students to International dance with contemporary element where they develop rhythm and grace.</p><p>Members will get to take part in the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF). They will also be given opportunities to put up performances for their fellow schoolmates during assembly.</p><table><tbody><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Day&nbsp; and Time</p></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Teachers- in-Charge</p></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Venue</p></th></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Tuesdays and Thursdays</p><p>2:15pm to 4:00pm</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>*Mdm Cheok Li Yee</p><p>*Ms Lim Li Joon</p><p>Mdm Felice Tang</p><p></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Dance Room (Level 2)</p><p>/ PAL Rm (D21)</p></td></tr></tbody></table><hr><p><br><br></p>
