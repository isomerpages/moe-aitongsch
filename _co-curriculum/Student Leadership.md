### Student Leadership Philosophy


Guided by the school vision of “A School of Dynamics Learners in the Culture of Care”, the Student Leadership Development (SLD) Programme in Ai Tong School seeks to nurture students to be the 4 dynamics leaders who are caring, responsible, respectful and resilient.

The school believes that there is a leader in every Ai Tong student and every student can lead. The SLD programme harnesses and develops the unique leadership potential of students based on their strengths, interests as well as leadership aptitude.

The programme uses the 3 ‘E’s approach to Experience, Engage and Empower to equip students with skills and knowledge through training programmes and exposing students to different experiences through meaningful platforms and opportunities for them to enact their learning resulting in a holistic leadership experience.

### The Student Leadership Development Structure

The SLD framework (Figure 1) identifies the three tiers of leadership: Self-Leadership 以身作则, Team Leadership 以智率群 and Servant Leadership 以德福群. 

In the 1st tier of Self-Leadership, the school sets the foundation of each Ai Tong School students to be effective leaders of themselves. In the 2nd tier of Team Leadership, structured platforms are provided for students to serve the school to develop students’ ability to care, lead and inspire. Lastly, in the 3rd tier of Servant Leadership, the school envisages that through the opportunities provided for students, they will be able to advocate a transformation in the community. The platforms and opportunities presented in each tier aims to develop and allow the students to make a significant degree of impact on their peers, school and beyond.

### ATS SLD Tier 1: Self-Leadership以身作则 (Experience)

All Ai Tong School students are given opportunities to serve either in leadership appointments, or as a class committee member. Tier 1 of the SLD programme equips all students with leadership knowledge and skills throughout their six years of education in the school. To help Ai Tong School student master self-leadership, a baseline leadership development is provided for all students.

Students are provided  with mass participation platforms and opportunities to develop desire, confidence and capacity to take ownership of one’s growth and development based on keen knowledge of self and sound values.

Leadership development is a whole school approach. To better equip each class leader in his/her job, the respective departments will conduct induction programmes to communicate clear expectations and terms of reference for the class committee roles. Through the session, the class leaders will learn the expectations of being the respective class leaders, duties and responsibilities and acquire planning and organisational skills for Values in Action (VIA) projects. These trainings are also differentiated for new and seasoned class leaders to enable a more targeted learning experience that will be conducted every semester.

The various class committee roles are:

### ATS SLD Tier 3: Servant Leadership 以德服众 (Empower)

Tier 3 of the SLD programme looks at servant leadership to equip student leaders of high leadership potential with the skills to impact processes by leading the team of Tier 2 student leaders and influence others positively. The Chairperson and Vice Chairperson of each SLC sub-committee will sit in the Executive Committee (EXCO) led by 3 Vice-Heads of SLC and a Head of SLC.

Each candidate for the Head of SLC position will campaign for the election. The campaign allows them to communicate their vision for the school as the Head of SLC. The Head of SLC will lead the Vice-Heads, EXCO and fellow student leaders to organise school wide events such as Teachers’ Day and Founder’s Day. 

Student Leader Council EXCO members develop <u>responsible decision making</u> skills through platforms and trainings to create a better environment for others and <u>empowering others</u> through inspiring commitment towards a common goal.
