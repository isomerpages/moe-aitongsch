<h3>Student Leadership Philosophy</h3>
<p>Guided by the school vision of “A School of Dynamics Learners in the Culture
of Care”, the Student Leadership Development (SLD) Programme in Ai Tong
School seeks to nurture students to be the 4 dynamics leaders who are caring,
responsible, respectful and resilient.</p>
<p>The school believes that there is a leader in every Ai Tong student and
every student can lead. The SLD programme harnesses and develops the unique
leadership potential of students based on their strengths, interests as
well as leadership aptitude.</p>
<p>The programme uses the 3 ‘E’s approach to Experience, Engage and Empower
to equip students with skills and knowledge through training programmes
and exposing students to different experiences through meaningful platforms
and opportunities for them to enact their learning resulting in a holistic
leadership experience.</p>
<h3>The Student Leadership Development Structure</h3>
<p>The SLD framework (Figure 1) identifies the three tiers of leadership:
Self-Leadership, Team Leadership and Servant Leadership.</p>
<p>In the 1st tier of Self-Leadership, the school sets the foundation of
each Ai Tong School students to be effective leaders of themselves. In
the 2nd tier of Team Leadership, structured platforms are provided for
students to serve the school to develop students’ ability to care, lead
and inspire. Lastly, in the 3rd tier of Servant Leadership, the school
envisages that through the opportunities provided for students, they will
be able to advocate a transformation in the community. The platforms and
opportunities presented in each tier aims to develop and allow the students
to make a significant degree of impact on their peers, school and beyond.</p>

<h3>ATS SLD Tier 1: Self-Leadership (Experience)</h3>
<p>All Ai Tong School students are given opportunities to serve either in
leadership appointments, or as a class committee member. Tier 1 of the
SLD programme equips all students with leadership knowledge and skills
throughout their six years of education in the school. To help Ai Tong
School student master self-leadership, a baseline leadership development
is provided for all students.</p>
<p>Students are provided with <u>mass participation</u> platforms and opportunities
to develop desire, confidence and capacity to <u>take ownership</u> of one’s
growth and development based on keen knowledge of self and sound values.</p>
<p>Leadership development is a whole school approach. To better equip each
class leader in his/her job, the respective departments will conduct induction
programmes to communicate clear expectations and terms of reference for
the class committee roles. Through the session, the class leaders will
learn the expectations of being the respective class leaders, duties and
responsibilities and acquire planning and organisational skills for Values
in Action (VIA) projects. These trainings are also differentiated for new
and seasoned class leaders to enable a more targeted learning experience
that will be conducted every semester.</p>
<p>The various class committee roles are:</p>
