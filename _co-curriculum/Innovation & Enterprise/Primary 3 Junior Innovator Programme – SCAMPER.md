Our P3 students are purposefully exposed to everyday things around them to create awareness that innovation is a way of thinking and it is all around us in our daily lives in this programme. They are guided to carefully observe and identify improvements that evolved from existing products to meet the needs of others. This is then tied in meaningfully with SCAMPER, a brainstorming tool, which scaffolds them to generate endless possible creative and wild ideas to innovate and make improvement to existing products. They work collaboratively with their team members to apply SCAMPER on given products, challenge themselves by thinking out of the box, and have fun innovating.
