Believing that children can make a positive impact on the community, Ai Tong School leverage on an authentic learning platform: Community Problem Solving (CmPS) Programme to equip Primary 5 students with problem solving skills. Working in groups, students embark on a learning journey to solve real life problems in the community of their choice using a 6-Step Problem Solving Process which will activate both their creative and critical thinking skills. Students need to identify challenges in an area of concern and select an underlying problem. Using SCAMPER as a creative thinking tool, students will produce a variety of solution ideas, be it product or services. Students are then taught to critically evaluate their solution ideas using an evaluation matrix. Finally, students will develop an Action Plan to implement their group solution. The school strives to empower them via various enrichment programmes like advanced coding lessons so that students are better equipped to generate a greater range of solutions and ways to present their solutions. As a grand finale to all the hard work they had put into their projects, our P5 students showcase their CmPS projects to their Primary 4 juniors in a CmPS Fair @ ATS.
