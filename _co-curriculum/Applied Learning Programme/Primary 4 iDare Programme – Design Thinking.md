<p>As a continuation of the P3 Junior iDare Programme, students are introduced
to the concept of Design Thinking - a process which focuses on collaboration
between designers (students) and users. The programme emphasises the value
of empathy by encouraging students to understand user experiences so that
they can identify user needs and create innovations to help them. The Design
Thinking process ends with prototyping where students create one best innovation
using the resources and time given. Our P4 students will learn to understand
that, with Design Thinking in the real world, there is a need to constantly
review and refine their innovation to make sure that it constantly addresses
the needs of the users. Design Thinking is an iterative, flexible process
– there is no ‘end’ in sight!</p>
