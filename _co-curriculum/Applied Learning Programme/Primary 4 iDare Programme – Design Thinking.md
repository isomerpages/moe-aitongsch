As a continuation of the P3 Junior Innovator Programme, students are introduced to the concept of Design Thinking - a process which focuses on collaboration between designers (students) and users. The programme emphasises the value of empathy by encouraging students to understand user experiences so that they can identify user needs and create innovations to help them. The Design Thinking process ends with prototyping where students create one best innovation using the resources and time given. Our P4 students will learn to understand that, with Design Thinking in the real world, there is a need to constantly review and refine their innovation to make sure that it constantly addresses the needs of the users. Design Thinking is an iterative, flexible process – there is no ‘end’ in sight!
