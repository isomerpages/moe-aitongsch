* **P4 Thinkers Programme**

This is one of the school’s key innovative talent development programmes. It is organised by the schools’ affiliated association, Singapore Hokkien Huay Kuan (SHHK). As part of the schools’ P4 Project Work Curriculum, students are introduced to Design Thinking as a framework to systematically solve problems. Through this level-wide project work platform, P4 teachers will identify students with aptitude and potential to join the talent development programme. Students in the talent development programme will participate in extensive training programmes organised for SHHK schools. Experts in the relevant fields would train these students and teachers. Students will showcase their projects at the end of the programme.

* **P5 Future Problem Solving Problem (CmPS)**

Community-based Problem Solving (CmPS) Programme is carried out as the school’s Primary 5 level-wide Project Work. The school leverages on this platform to identify and shortlist outstanding teams which will continue to refine and improve on their CmPS projects after their presentations in ATS’s annual CmPS school fair. The selected teams are closely guided by teacher facilitators, who are also trained FPSP coaches, to earn their places to participate in the yearly local Affiliate Bowl and the International competition in Future Problem Solving Programme (FPSP) International Conference. 

In 2022, two teams of Ai Tong School students emerged victorious from the Community Problem Solving (CmPS) National Finals 2021 held at Raffles Girls School.  Team Project DeSTRESS from 5 Creativity was awarded 2nd place in the Junior Division and the team working on Reducing Food Waste from 5 Diligence was presented with the Beyonder Award. Both teams were invited to compete in the Future Problem Solving Program (FPSP) International Conference in June 2022. They participated as virtual participants and had the golden opportunity to learn from international mentors and students on how they solve community issues around the world!

Together with their form teachers and mentors, the teams showed great determination and resilience in preparing for the International Conference amidst their PSLE preparation in Semester 1 this year.  They worked well as a team and created great camaraderie throughout the journey. They were also well-prepared and confident when they faced the panel of judges from United States. Their hard work and effort finally paid off! Team Project DeSTRESS was awarded the first runner-up in the Junior Division among a total of 13 teams! Congratulations to both teams who have done Ai Tong School proud at the international level.
