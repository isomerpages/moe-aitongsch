The P6 Gratitude-in-Action (GIA) is a VIA project which uses the Heart-Head-Hand approach. It aims to engage the ‘Heart’ of the students to appreciate and show gratitude for what they have, as well as understand how they can make a difference to the community. The project also activates their ‘Head’ and mind to acquire skills and knowledge to overcome challenges and reflect on their experiences. It eventually involves students to use their ‘Hands’ to create handmade goods or games out of recycling materials to raise funds for Social Service Agencies (SSAs).

The project is delivered through different lessons including English Language, Art & Crafts, and Mathematics. Through these lessons, they will learn about the success stories of social entrepreneurs, marketing strategies, advertising techniques, pricing and use of recycling materials to create products. A major component of this GIA project is the infusion of financial literacy lesson through Mathematics lessons. The aim is to equip our students with the knowledge and skills to make effective and informed money management decisions. 

Along with these acquired skills, the relevant knowledge which they picked up during their P3 to P5 Project Work, e.g. SCAMPER, Design Thinking Process, 6-step Problem Solving Process are also aptly applied to the formation of class booths for the GIA Fair held annually in early-November.
