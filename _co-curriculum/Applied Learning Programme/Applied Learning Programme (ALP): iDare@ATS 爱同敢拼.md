In Ai Tong School, we seek to create a conducive environment that promotes a pervasive culture of innovation as a way of life where “_Everyone thinks and Everyone innovates_”. We want our teachers and students to develop an **entrepreneurial dare** so that they will act on their curiosity, apply what they learn and innovate to make a positive change.  

To “**dare**”, resilience is key. Because it is often the fear of failure that holds many of us back. That is why we believe it is importance to develop **Growth Mindset** in our students in school and at home.

At the core of this Applied Learning Programme (ALP), as depicted in the framework below, we aim to develop students’ 21st Century Competencies in _Critical & Inventive Thinking and Communication_ and _Collaboration & Information Skills_.

We design programmes to connect classroom learning with real-life applications and to encourage students to creatively apply project work skills to solve authentic problems collaboratively. These programmes are specially curated for Primary 3 to Primary 6 students beyond the academic curriculum. The programmes provide opportunities to challenge and stretch students to apply and integrate their content knowledge and skills to problem solve creatively or design new products and experiences through collaborative learning. The curriculum is designed to develop skills in our students to prepare them for lifelong learning and enable them to effect change in the community.
