<p>In Ai Tong School, we seek to create a conducive environment that promotes
a pervasive culture of innovation as a way of life where “<em>Everyone thinks and Everyone innovates</em>”.
We want our students to develop a <strong>dare-to-try spirit</strong> where
they will act on their curiosity, apply what they learn and innovate to
make a positive change.</p>
<p>To “<strong>dare</strong>”, resilience is key. Because it is often the
fear of failure that holds many of us back. That is why we believe it is
importance to develop <strong>Growth Mindset</strong> in our students in
school and at home.</p>
<p>At the core of this Applied Learning Programme (ALP), as depicted in the
framework below, we aim to develop students’ 21st Century Competencies
in <em>Critical &amp; Inventive Thinking and Communication</em> and <em>Collaboration &amp; Information Skills</em>.</p>

<p>We design programmes to connect classroom learning with real-life applications
and to encourage students to creatively apply project work skills to solve
authentic problems collaboratively. These programmes are specially curated
for Primary 3 to Primary 6 students beyond the academic curriculum. The
programmes provide opportunities to challenge and stretch students to apply
and integrate their content knowledge and skills to problem solve creatively
or design new products and experiences through collaborative learning.
The curriculum is designed to develop skills in our students to prepare
them for lifelong learning and enable them to effect change in the community.</p>
