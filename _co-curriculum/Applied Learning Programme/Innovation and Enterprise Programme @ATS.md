Innovation and Enterprise Programme @ATS caters to Primary 3 to Primary 6 students beyond the academic curriculum. The four-year programme provides opportunities to challenge and stretch students to apply and integrate their content knowledge and skills to problem solve creatively or design new products and experiences through collaborative learning. The curriculum is designed to develop skills in our students to prepare them for lifelong learning and enable them to effect change in the community. Project work provides a learning experience for our young learners to work collaboratively with one another to synthesize knowledge from various areas of learning, and apply it critically and creatively to real-life situations.
