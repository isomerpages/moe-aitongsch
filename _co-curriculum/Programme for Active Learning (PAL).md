In line with the Primary Education Review and Implementation (PERI) recommendations, Programme for Active Learning (PAL) was introduced to strengthen the emphasis on non-academic programmes for Primary 1 and 2 students. Conducted within curriculum time, PAL modules provide students with broad exposure in two broad areas — Sports and Outdoor Education, and Performing and Visual Arts. It aims to facilitate the well-rounded development of students in the five learning domains (cognitive, moral, social, aesthetics and physical) and help students to develop social emotional competencies.
