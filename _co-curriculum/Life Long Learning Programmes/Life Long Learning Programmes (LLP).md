**Lifelong Learning Programmes (LLP) in ATS**

Awarded two LLP status in 2015, Ai Tong School continues to commit to our school vision to provide holistic learning experiences for all students. LLPs aim for them to be able to connect with others, hone social and emotional competencies, find purpose and passion in life and contribute to the society.

  

‘**Caring Through Arts’** features 2 key programmes: (1) Rhythm of the Arts (2) Fun with Arts. Through these two programmes, we aim to provide students a holistic learning experience, giving them opportunities to learn and grow in various aspects apart from just the theoretical learning of music/art knowledge and skills. Students learn to care and appreciate different cultures and values, and have the opportunities to put their values into action through preparation for performances and creating art pieces. The SEC and 21st CC such as respect for self and others, global awareness and cross-cultural skills will carry them through life, learning how to appreciate cultural uniqueness and beautiful things in life.

  

‘**Character & Leadership Development through Outdoor Education Programme’:** **L.E.A.D (Lead, Environment, Adventure, Develop) @ Ai Tong School** is a school-wide programme that involves all students from Primary 1 to Primary 6. The activities are progressively planned to suit the ages of the students. Through these activities, students experience varied levels of challenges and develop toughness (physical), resilience (mental & emotional), teamwork (social) and an appreciation of nature and their surroundings.
