<h2>L.E.A.D (Lead, Environment, Adventure, Develop) @ ATS</h2>
<p>The LLP provides students with authentic experiential learning to develop
their values and character,&nbsp;nurture positive attitudes, self-expression,
and strengthen their people skills.</p>
<h3>L.E.A.D: Character and Leadership Development through Outdoor Education</h3>
<p>Outdoor Education (OE) in Ai Tong School is an integrated approach to
learning and development in&nbsp;which Social Emotional Learning (SEL)
and specific outdoor skillsets are nurtured through concrete&nbsp;experiences
as ‘experiential learning’ is the trademark of outdoor education.</p>
<p>Outdoor Education is the perfect avenue to enable students to enjoy challenging
and unfamiliar&nbsp;experiences that test and develop their physical, social
and personal skills.</p>
<h3>L.E.A.D (Lead, Environment, Adventure, Develop) @ Ai Tong School</h3>
<p>Outdoor Education (OE) was introduced in Ai Tong in 2011. As recognition
of the effective and&nbsp;successful implementation of the OE programmes,
MOE affirmed ‘Outdoor Education’ as the&nbsp;school’s Learning for Life
Programme (LLP) in March 2015.</p>
<p>L.E.A.D @ ATS is a school-wide programme that involves all students from
Primary 1 to Primary 6.&nbsp;The activities are progressively planned to
suit the ages of the students. Through these activities,&nbsp;students
experience varied levels of challenges and develop toughness (physical),
resilience (mental&nbsp;&amp; emotional), teamwork (social) and an appreciation
of nature and their surroundings.</p>
