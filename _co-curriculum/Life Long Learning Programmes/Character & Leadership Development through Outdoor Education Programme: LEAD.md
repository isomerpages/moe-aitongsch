#### Character & Leadership Development through Outdoor Education Programme: L.E.A.D (Lead, Environment, Adventure, Develop) @ ATS (LLP2)

The LLP provides students with authentic experiential learning to develop their values and character, nurture positive attitudes, self-expression, and strengthen their people skills.

### L.E.A.D: Character and Leadership Development through Outdoor Education

Outdoor Education (OE) in Ai Tong School is an integrated approach to learning and development in which Social Emotional Learning (SEL) and specific outdoor skillsets are nurtured through concrete experiences as ‘experiential learning’ is the trademark of outdoor education.  
 
Outdoor Education is the perfect avenue to enable students to enjoy challenging and unfamiliar experiences that test and develop their physical, social and personal skills.

### L.E.A.D (Lead, Environment, Adventure, Develop) @ Ai Tong School

Outdoor Education (OE) was introduced in Ai Tong in 2011. As recognition of the effective and successful implementation of the OE programmes, MOE affirmed ‘Outdoor Education’ as the school’s Learning for Life Programme (LLP) in March 2015.

L.E.A.D @ ATS is a school-wide programme that involves all students from Primary 1 to Primary 6. The activities are progressively planned to suit the ages of the students. Through these activities, students experience varied levels of challenges and develop toughness (physical), resilience (mental & emotional), teamwork (social) and an appreciation of nature and their surroundings.
