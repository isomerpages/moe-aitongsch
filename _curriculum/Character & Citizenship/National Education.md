Approach
--------

Head: Know, Think and Understand

Students are actively involved in learning by taking individual responsibility to promulgate a curiosity towards learning about others, think and arrive at a deeper understanding of Singapore's challenges and what it means to be a Singaporean.  
  

Heart: Love, Appreciate and Belong

Students stay connected emotionally to Singapore and develop their love for the nation through appreciating Singapore and having a deeper sense of belonging.

  

Hands: Contribute, Create and Lead

Students have opportunities to give back to the society, knowing that everyone has a part to contribute to and create Singapore's future as well as to lead in different fields of society. The customised in-house school programmes enable our students to appreciate the different cultures and practices of different ethnicity and cultures as well as to advocate active citizenship to contribute to the progress of our community and the nation.

NE Commemorative Days
---------------------

The four core NE days which are linked to the important points in Singapore’s history are commemorated. The aim is to entrench these events and images they evoke in the consciousness of each successive generation. Learning activities and programmes planned help to create a holistic learning experience for the students.

### School-based Key Programmes

Ensuring a rich and comprehensive experience, our students will be learning about the different festivals, cultures and practices to increase their awareness and develop a sense of respect and appreciation for other customs and traditions.
