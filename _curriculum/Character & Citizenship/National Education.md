<h2>Approach</h2>
<p>Head: Know, Think and Understand</p>
<p>Students are actively involved in learning by taking individual responsibility
to promulgate a&nbsp;curiosity towards learning about others, think and
arrive at a deeper understanding of&nbsp;Singapore's challenges and what
it means to be a Singaporean.</p>
<p>Heart: Love, Appreciate and Belong</p>
<p>Students stay connected emotionally to Singapore and develop their love
for the nation&nbsp;through appreciating Singapore and having a deeper
sense of belonging.</p>
<p>Hands: Contribute, Create and Lead</p>
<p>Students have opportunities to give back to the society, knowing that
everyone has a part to&nbsp;contribute to and create Singapore's future
as well as to lead in different fields of society.&nbsp;The customised
in-house school programmes enable our students to appreciate the&nbsp;different
cultures and practices of different ethnicity and cultures as well as to
advocate&nbsp;active citizenship to contribute to the progress of our community
and the nation.</p>
<h2>NE Commemorative Days</h2>
<p>The four core NE days which are linked to the important points in Singaporeâ€™s
history are&nbsp;commemorated. The aim is to entrench these events and
images they evoke in the&nbsp;consciousness of each successive generation.
Learning activities and programmes planned&nbsp;help to create a holistic
learning experience for the students.</p>
