<p>In Character and Citizenship Education (CCE), our students learn to be
responsible to family and community; and understand their roles in shaping
the future of our nation. The emerging trends and global developments that
impact our society, such as societal changes, globalisation and technological
advancements are taken into consideration in the development of the CCE
curriculum.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The goal of CCE is to inculcate values and build competencies in our students
to develop them to be good individuals and useful citizens. The core values
(Respect, Responsibility, Resilience, Integrity, Care and Harmony) are
fundamental for a person of good character and a useful citizen of Singapore.
They guide students to discern between right and wrong, helping them to
make responsible choices and become more aware of their roles in society.</p>
<p>The skills related to citizenship competencies enable students to function
effectively as concerned citizens who stay rooted to Singapore. This aligns
with the goal of CCE to nurture our students to be citizens of good character.
The curriculum is delivered in the Mother Tongue Language.</p>

<h3>Framework</h3>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/CCE_framework_ATS.jpeg">
</div>
<p>The framework encapsulates the objectives, spirit and approach of CCE
in Ai Tong School. The framework is undergirded by our school values.</p>
<p>The Head, Hand, Heart approach is used for our key programmes such as
National Education (NE), Character and Citizenship Education (CCE), Values-in-action
(VIA), Social Studies (SS) and Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP). They
are in place to inculcate values and develop competencies in our students
so as to develop them into upright individuals and useful citizens. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In engaging the “Head”, students will be involved in their own learning
to acquire skills, knowledge and dispositions to overcome challenges and
turning them into opportunities as well as to think and reflect on their
experiences to better internalise them.</p>
<p>In engaging the “Heart”, students will appreciate the history and heritage
that make Singapore unique in her own way through various platforms. Students
will learn to embrace differences as positives making Singapore a more
vibrant, connected and strong society.</p>
<p>In engaging the “Hands”, students will have opportunities to give back
to society and play their part to contribute in the building a better Singapore.</p>
<p>The “Head, Hand, Heart approach is guided by the four principles of quality,
ownership, customisation and coherence. For all programmes, we emphasise
on quality, greater ownership by the different groups of stakeholders,
the need to customise and differentiate programmes to cater for varying
needs, interest and maturity levels of the students and to ensure coherence
in the programmes we have.</p>
<p>The outer-most ring represents our four key groups of stakeholders that
are involved, namely students, teachers, parents and partners. Everyone
plays a part in CCE.</p>
