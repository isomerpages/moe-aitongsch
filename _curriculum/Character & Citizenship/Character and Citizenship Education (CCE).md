In Character and Citizenship Education (CCE), our students learn to be responsible to family and community; and understand their roles in shaping the future of our nation. The emerging trends and global developments that impact our society, such as societal changes, globalisation and technological advancements are taken into consideration in the development of the CCE curriculum. 

The goal of CCE is to inculcate values and build competencies in our students to develop them to be good individuals and useful citizens. The core values (Respect, Responsibility, Resilience, Integrity, Care and Harmony) are fundamental for a person of good character and a useful citizen of Singapore. They guide students to discern between right and wrong, helping them to make responsible choices and become more aware of their roles in society.

The skills related to citizenship competencies enable students to function effectively as concerned citizens who stay rooted to Singapore. This aligns with the goal of CCE to nurture our students to be citizens of good character. The curriculum is delivered in the Mother Tongue Language.

### Framework


![](/images/CCE_framework_ATS.jpeg)

The framework encapsulates the objectives, spirit and approach of CCE in Ai Tong School. The framework is undergirded by our school values.  
  
The Head, Hand, Heart approach is used for our key programmes such as National Education (NE), Character and Citizenship Education (CCE), Values-in-action (VIA), Social Studies (SS) and Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP). They are in place to inculcate values and develop competencies in our students so as to develop them into upright individuals and useful citizens.    
  
In engaging the “Head”, students will be involved in their own learning to acquire skills, knowledge and dispositions to overcome challenges and turning them into opportunities as well as to think and reflect on their experiences to better internalise them.  
  
In engaging the “Heart”, students will appreciate the history and heritage that make Singapore unique in her own way through various platforms. Students will learn to embrace differences as positives making Singapore a more vibrant, connected and strong society.  
  
In engaging the “Hands”, students will have opportunities to give back to society and play their part to contribute in the building a better Singapore.  
  
The “Head, Hand, Heart approach is guided by the four principles of quality, ownership, customisation and coherence. For all programmes, we emphasise on quality, greater ownership by the different groups of stakeholders, the need to customise and differentiate programmes to cater for varying needs, interest and maturity levels of the students and to ensure coherence in the programmes we have.  
  
The outer-most ring represents our four key groups of stakeholders that are involved, namely students, teachers, parents and partners. Everyone plays a part in CCE.
