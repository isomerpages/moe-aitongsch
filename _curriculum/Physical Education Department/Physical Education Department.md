### Introduction

Physical Education (P.E.) is a crucial component of our students’ holistic experience in Ai Tong School. The school strongly advocates that physical activity is necessary to a child’s well-being. In Ai Tong School, we aim to provide our students with a structured and wide-ranging P.E. curriculum. The intended outcomes of a quality physical education experience are that all students are provided with the skills, knowledge and attitude necessary to lead a life-long physically active lifestyle. 

### Learning Outcomes

Goal 1: Acquire a range of movement skills to participate in a variety of physical activities.

Goal 2: Understand and apply movement concepts, principles and strategies in a range of physical activities.

Goal 3: Demonstrate safe practices during physical and daily activities with respect to themselves, others and the environment.

Goal 4: Display positive personal and social behaviour across different experiences.

Goal 5: Acquire and maintain health-enhancing fitness through regular participation in physical activities.

Goal 6: Enjoy and value the benefits of living a physically active and healthy life.

  

### Summary of Curriculum

In Ai Tong School, students learn the fundamental movement skills incorporating the movement concepts. They develop proficiency, effectiveness and flexibility as they practice and transfer their skills across the seven learning areas of Athletics, Dance, Games and Sports, Gymnastics, Outdoor Education, Physical Health and Fitness, and Swimming to become confident and competent movers.

### Special Programmes and Events

Beyond the P.E. curriculum, Ai Tong School also provides platforms and opportunities for students to develop their sporting interests and talents.

**Modular Sports Enrichment**

Through our Modular Sports Enrichment, Primary 5 and 6 students will be exposed to a variety of physical activities either as an extension of what they have learned in P.E. or learning of a new game or sport i.e. Flying Disk. 

Mini Sports and Sports Fiesta

To inculcate the values of Sportsmanship, Fair play and Teamwork, the Lower Primary students (Primary 1 - Primary 3) take part in the annual Mini Sports where the students compete in a four-game interclass sports day.  
To promote a sporting for life mind set, the Upper Primary students (P4-P6) partake in the annual Sports Fiesta, a sports carnival with various booths set up by the CCA Leaders. At the carnival, students try out various sports and games that include both individual and team sports in a non-competitive environment.   

**SHHK Combined Sports Meet**

The Primary 4 and Primary 6 students also attend the annual 5-School-Singapore Hokkien Huay Kwan-Sports Meet where athletes from the affiliated schools compete in various track and field events. This event allows the school’s athletes to compete with four other Hokkien Huay Kuan Schools, namely, Tao Nan School, Chongfu School, Kong Hwa School and Nan Chiau Primary School. The event also serves to forge better ties among the staff and students from the 5 schools.

**Active@ATS**

The school has implemented a structured recess play programme titled ‘Active@ATS’ where students have the opportunity to try various modified sports and games such as beach volleyball and skipping to discover their interests and form comradery through play.

**Other Activities**

To further broaden their general knowledge, assembly talks on Healthy Lifestyle and Sporting Events are conducted for our students. The students also attend talks and programmes by the Health Promotion Board such as the Blood Pressure Monitor programme.

In a nutshell, Physical Education is a vital piece of the Ai Tong School experience. A physically active student who understands the Health and Fitness components is more likely to be academically motivated and focused in life.
