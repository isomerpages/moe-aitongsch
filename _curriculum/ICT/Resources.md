<h3>Educational Apps</h3>
<p>To deepen students’ learning and keep them actively engaged during lessons,
our teachers use a wide range of apps such as Moo-O to bring out the joy
of learning.</p>

<h3>iPads</h3>
<p>Students use iPads for their easy to manipulate touch screen technology.
Due to their portable format and fast load-up time, it makes learning more
engaging and interactive for the students. They have endless access to
valuable information such as dictionary and thesaurus and other apps that
bring education to life.</p>
<h3>Green Screen Technology</h3>
<p>Our school strives to create an exciting and engaging learning environment
in which students have the opportunities to explore new digital tools and
resources. Students use the green screen technology to immerse themselves
in different settings and make their presentations more lively and interesting.
During I Love English week, students get to dress up in their favourite
characters and take some shots using the green screen backdrop. They definitely
have fun, posing and imitating the different characters.</p>
<h3>Student Learning Space (SLS) Portal</h3>
<p>The SLS is MOE's core platform for teaching and learning and is one of
MOE’s key initiatives to transform the learning experiences of Singaporean
students through the purposeful use of technology to enable students to
engage in different learning modes.</p>

Sheets and Slides as well as other school-related apps. It helps to better

<h3>Communication Platform</h3>
<p>Other than communicating with Parents via platforms such as Parents Gateway
and Parents’ Portal, our teachers also use the ClassDojo app to post announcements
and updates on Class Story, share photos and videos of classroom activities
and send private messages to keep them updated of their child’s progress.
Parents are encouraged to use this platform to alert teachers when their
child is absent from school. It also helps to build positive classroom
environment. Class subject teachers are able to give feedback to students
on important values and life skills like “Working hard” and “Participating.”</p>
