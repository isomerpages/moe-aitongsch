### Educational Apps

To deepen students’ learning and keep them actively engaged during lessons, our teachers use a wide range of apps such as MC Online Oral Buddy and Moo-O to bring out the joy of learning.

### iPads

Students use iPads for their easy to manipulate touch screen technology. Due to their portable format and fast load-up time, it makes learning more engaging and interactive for the students. They have endless access to valuable information such as dictionary and thesaurus and other apps that bring education to life.

### Green Screen Technology

Our school strives to create an exciting and engaging learning environment in which students have the opportunities to explore new digital tools and resources. Students use the green screen technology to immerse themselves in different settings and make their presentations more lively and interesting. During I Love English week, students get to dress up in their favourite characters and take some shots using the green screen backdrop. They definitely have fun, posing and imitating the different characters. 

### Student Learning Space (SLS) Portal


The SLS is MOE's core platform for teaching and learning and is one of MOE’s key initiatives to transform the learning experiences of Singaporean students through the purposeful use of technology to enable students to engage in different learning modes.


Click here to access [SLS](https://vle.learning.moe.edu.sg/) Portal. You can also refer to [ATS Student Resource Hub SLS](https://sites.google.com/moe.edu.sg/ats-student/account/student-learning-spacesls) Page for FAQs.

Note: For students who do not have a computer or mobile device at home, they can check if they qualify for one via the NEU PC Plus Programme by IMDA ([click here for more information](https://www.imda.gov.sg/neupc)).



### Communication Platform

Other than communicating with Parents via platforms such as Parents Gateway and Parents’ Portal, our teachers also use the ClassDojo app to post announcements and updates on Class Story, share photos and videos of classroom activities and send private messages to keep them updated of their child’s progress. Parents are encouraged to use this platform to alert teachers when their child is absent from school. It also helps to build positive classroom environment. Class subject teachers are able to give feedback to students on important values and life skills like “Working hard” and “Participating.”
