### IT Labs & Mobile Carts
Undergirding quality learning with ICT is a set of future-ready and scalable infrastructure in the school. Students can learn anytime and anywhere with the widened coverage of wireless access. To better support students in their learning, all desktops will be replaced with notebooks to enhance mobility and promote teaching and learning outside the classrooms.

### Teaching Lab
Our teaching lab has space that is flexible enough to allow for whole-class instruction, small groups, and independent work. Teachers have the options to decide on the best configuration of the layout based on the lesson learning objectives. There is an observation area where teachers can do peer observations without interfering with the conduct of the lesson.
