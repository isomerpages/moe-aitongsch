### Introduction

At Ai Tong School, the science department hopes to nurture students to be self-directed learners with curious minds and a heart for the environment.

Hence, our department objectives are to:

•	educate students to achieve high scientific literacy through the provision of a science learning environment that excites, engages and extends students’ knowledge using hands-on, inquiry-based learning strategies.

•	equip students with competencies to meet the challenges of the 21st century through the integration of social emotional learning, ICT, self-directed and collaborative learning in the teaching of science.

The following is an overview of topics taught from P3 to P6 (Standard Science).
