The Science Curriculum Framework
--------------------------------

The Singapore Primary Science Curriculum Framework encapsulates the thrust of science education in Singapore to prepare our students to be sufficiently adept as effective citizens, able to function in and contribute to an increasingly technologically-driven world.  
  

Central to the curriculum framework is the inculcation of the spirit of scientific inquiry. The conduct of inquiry is founded on three integral domains of (a) Knowledge, Understanding and Application, (b) Skills and Processes and (c) Ethics and Attitudes. It seeks to enable students to view the pursuit of science as meaningful and useful. Inquiry is thus grounded in knowledge, issues and questions that relate to the roles played by science in daily life, society and the environment.

### Introduction

At Ai Tong School, the science department hopes to nurture students to be self-directed learners with curious minds and a heart for the environment.

  

Hence, our department objectives are to:

1\. educate students to achieve high scientific literacy through the provision of a science learning environment that excites, engages and extends students’ knowledge using hands-on, inquiry-based learning strategies.

2\. equip students with competencies to meet the challenges of the 21st century through the integration of social emotional learning, ICT, self-directed and collaborative learning in the teaching of science.

  

Both formative and summative assessments are used to provide feedback on students’ learning. In an inquiry-based classroom, the assessment can take many forms. In addition to the written tests, teachers can also use the following modes to provide feedback:
*   Practicals
*   Projects
*   Teacher observations
*   Checklists
*   Reflections
*   Model-making  
    

### Key Programmes


*   Every Child a seed programme with NParks (Primary 3) 

This programme seeks to provide students with an opportunity to grow their very own plant. Every Primary 3 student will be provided with a plant starter kit from NParks, consisting of a pot, potting mix and some seeds. The three types of seeds which will be given out are kang kong, sunflower and roselle.

This gives them a chance to observe the life cycle of plants as described in their textbook. They also go through and appreciate the challenges of the planting process and experience the joy of seeing their plants grow.  We also hope to cultivate in the students a heart for the environment.

*   Thinking like a scientist project work
    

Students are given opportunities to use process skills taught e.g. observing, using apparatus and equipment, comparing, inferring, analysing skills etc to problem solve, make decisions or investigate on a scientific question during project work. Tasks are carried out over a period of time and feedback is given after students undertake each task before proceeding to the next so that the learning process through the project work is enhanced.

*   Use of ICT
    

ICT lessons are incorporated into our school-based activity packages to provide platforms for students to carry out self-directed learning to extend their knowledge of how scientific concepts learnt are used in daily lives. Other ICT tools as well as the student learning space (SLS) are also tapped on to allow students to carry out cooperative and collaborative learning effectively.

*   Enrichment programmes
    

Suitable science enrichment programmes are arranged for students to further inculcate in them the love for exploration using tangible learning experiences that involve making, building, playing and creating to stimulate critical and creative thinking with an inclination towards stem education.

*   Discovery Play on Thursdays
    
Students will have the opportunities to carry out various science activities during their recesses that demonstrate science concepts within and beyond the primary school syllabus. We hope to increase their excitement and love for science through these activities which include leaf printing, shadow puppets, layered liquids of different densities, structure building using straws, exploring chromatography, paper circuits etc.
