<p>The <em>EL Syllabus 2020 </em>is undergirded by the principles of EL teaching
and learning (CLLIPS) and EL teaching processes (ACoLADE). A pedagogical
emphasis on Multiliteracies, Metacognition, and Inquiry through Dialogue
in the EL classroom helps to develop knowledge of language and ensures
effective and affective language use for all EL learners. The approach
to language teaching and learning ensures a firm and rich foundation for
all for future learning.</p>
<p>Students’ language use is reflected in the following areas of language
learning:</p>
