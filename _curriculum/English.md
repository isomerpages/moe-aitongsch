<p>The overarching aim of the EL Syllabus 2010 is to develop effective language
use. Students’ language use will be affected by the purpose, audience,
context and culture (PACC) and their proficiency in language use is assessed
by their attainment of the learning outcomes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students’ language use is reflected in the following areas of language
learning:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Listening and Viewing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reading and Viewing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Speaking and Representing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Writing and Representing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Grammar</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vocabulary</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To develop these areas of language learning in students, teachers are
guided by the six Principles of EL Teaching and Learning (CLLIPS) and will
take into account the Teaching Processes (ACoLADE).</p>

<p>Ai Tong School aims to develop our students to become Bilingual Communicators,
striving to be a school of Dynamic Learners in a Culture of Care. The programmes
and activities in the English Language Department support the MOE CPDD
EL vision, and set out to equip our students with the skills to serve them
well in the 21st century.</p>
<p>The table below provides a summary of ATS EL Department’s key programmes
and activities</p>

<p><strong>I Love EL Week</strong>
</p>
<p>In order to build a vibrant EL culture, sustain interest in the language
and support the holistic development of students, a variety of language
activities have been planned to engage the students. These differentiated
activities that cater to the various levels take place at mass platforms
like assembly and recess, and also in the individual classrooms. Having
the different areas of language learning in mind, activities allow students
to demonstrate their listening, speaking, reading and writing skills.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Language Arts Programme (LAP)</strong>
</p>
<p>Using award-winning titles to teach English Language is one of the key
features of the LAP launched in Ai Tong School in July 2010. The programme
aims to raise the level of reading competency, enrich students’ learning
experience in English Language, ignite students’ passion for reading, and
develop their critical thinking skills. Storybooks present an ideal context
for literacy practice as well as linguistic acquisition. It also provides
the backdrop for a conducive and creative environment for language learning.</p>
<p><strong>LAP Performance Day</strong>
</p>
<p>The LAP Performance Day concludes the Language Arts Programme with a finale
performance staged by all P3 and P4 students based on the literature texts
of Charlotte’s Web and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Both teachers
and students work hand-in-hand to put together a performance that peers
from the level watch together. With this platform, students practise voice
projection, demonstrate effective characterisation and last but not least,
display showmanship and observe appropriate etiquette as the audience.</p>
<p><strong>Eng-trigued Tuesdays</strong>
</p>
<p>Every Tuesday, students get the chance to engage in language activities
that align to themes featured in the library. Such activities range from
vocabulary games to videos that allow for language exploration.</p>
<p><strong>I Love Reading</strong>
</p>
<p>To cultivate the reading habit in every student and promote a continuous
love for reading, roving teacher-spies go round the school to catch students
in the act of reading. P1 and P2 students are exposed to reading activities
in the Be Enthusiastic About Reading (B.E.A.R) card while P3 and P4 students
are encouraged to complete their Young Readers Card which comprises of
a variety of language activities that anchor on a good book. P4 to P6 students
are also introduced to appropriate reading materials that ensures exposure
to different genres as well as current affairs.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Speak it Right!</strong>
</p>
<p>This programme reinforces the accurate use of day-to-day interactional
language using Speak Good English Movement (SGEM) resources. Students are
also introduced to thematic content language which would build the individual’s
competencies in speaking and writing.</p>
<p><strong>What’s Up!</strong>
</p>
<p>What’s Up provides a regular platform for students to present to a larger
audience, e.g. during assembly. These opportunities allow students to hone
their public speaking skills and boost their confidence. This presentation
of news articles keeps students abreast of happenings in the community
and develops the concerned citizen in them.</p>
<p><strong>I Can Write!</strong>
</p>
<p>Riding on the belief that every student can be a writer, I Can Write!
encourages students to participate in internal writing competitions, exercise
their creativity and write freely based on an interesting theme.</p>
<p>The Department also adopts a variety of strategies and approaches for
teaching and learning, as summarised in the table below.</p>
