### Framework

![](/images/EL_framework.png)

The overarching aim of the EL Syllabus 2010 is to develop effective language use. Students’ language use will be affected by the purpose, audience, context and culture (PACC) and their proficiency in language use is assessed by their attainment of the learning outcomes. 


Students’ language use is reflected in the following areas of language learning:

*   Listening and Viewing
*   Reading and Viewing    
*   Speaking and Representing   
*   Writing and Representing
*   Grammar
*   Vocabulary
    

  
To develop these areas of language learning in students, teachers are guided by the six Principles of EL Teaching and Learning (CLLIPS) and will take into account the Teaching Processes (ACoLADE).

**When planning EL lessons, teachers will employ ACoLADE during the delivery of the pre, main and post phases of their EL lessons.**
