### Our School Logo 校徽

<img src="/images/ATS-Logo-web.png" style="width:15%">
		 
The school name reflects that Ai Tong School was founded out of love for children in 1912. The Chinese characters “爱同” were derived from the phrase, “love to all and sundry”.

爱同学校创办于1912年。 校名取自“博爱大同”里的“爱同”两个字。“博爱”的意思是普遍地爱所有的人。“大同”是指人人平等、自由的社会景象。

The school logo resembles a flying wheel. The circles symbolise the cohesive spirit of the teachers and pupils
working together towards a common goal. The pair of wings symbolises the school soaring to greater heights,
seeking higher aspirations and excellence. The character “同” gives the school its name, Ai Tong School.

校徽似飞轮状，圆圈象征全体师生为共同目标同心协力而奋斗的精神。翅膀象征展翅高飞、鹏程万里，而 “同” 字代表爱同学校。
