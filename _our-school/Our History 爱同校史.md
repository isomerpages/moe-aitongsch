<p><strong>1912-1917:</strong>&nbsp;Ai Tong School was founded by Pastor
Ong Kah Mok out of love for children. He felt that the children of Chinese
immigrants should receive a proper education. The school’s name "Ai Tong",
was derived from the phrase "love to all and sundry".</p>
<p>Working with Mr Koh Chee Hou, a teacher from Tao Nan School, Ai Tong was
founded on 12 October 1912. The school officially commenced lessons for
its first intake of students on 8 July 1913, with Mr Koh as its first principal.
Originally, the school with only 30 pupils, was housed in a Methodist Church
at Boon Tat Street. The school was re-sited at 209, Telok Ayer Street in
1917.</p>
