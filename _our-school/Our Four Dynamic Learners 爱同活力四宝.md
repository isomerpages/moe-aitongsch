A re-envisioning exercise in 2011 provided Ai Tong School with the impetus to visually encapsulate the school values and our aspired student outcomes. Stakeholders were involved in the designing of the four dynamic learners and the design by student Ang Yi Jia of 3D 2011 was selected as the representation of our dynamic learners. The Four “Dynamic Learners” are each holding heart-shaped cut-outs that contain graphic representation of their definitions. This denotes the importance of the role of our “**HEART**”, being the fundamental element in achieving the definition of the “Dynamic Learners”. We use our heart to LISTEN, THINK and DO. That is 一切从“**心**”出发。
