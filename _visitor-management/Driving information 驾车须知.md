### Driving within the school compound

Drive slowly and keep to a speed limit of 15 km/h when you enter the school compound. Get your child to be ready to alight or board when your car approaches the designated drop-off/pick-up points i.e. either at the School Transport Hub or at the Foyer. Your child should alight swiftly on the side nearest to the kerb. Please comply with instructions from security guards and traffic wardens on duty. Your patience and co-operation while waiting to drop-off/pick-up your child would be appreciated.  
  

### Driving along Sin Min Avenue (within school vicinity)

Please adhere to the speed limit of 40 km/h while driving along the school zone area.  Stay alert for pedestrians and do not sound the horn indiscriminately.  Please refrain from alighting or picking up your child along Sin Ming Avenue, right outside School Gate A and B, and where the bus stop is located. This is to avoid traffic congestion and inconvenience to other road users, given that there are only two road lanes.  
  

Please note that there is no right turn for all vehicles (except school buses) when departing from the school exit gate (Motorised Sliding Gate). Please turn left at the exit gate and make a U-Turn further down Bright Hill Drive.
