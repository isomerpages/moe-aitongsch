Dear Parents / Guardians,  
  

For the safety and security of our students, we seek your understanding and cooperation to adhere to the following should you need to pick up your child/ward from school before the dismissal time of 1.30pm:

  

1\. Sign in at the Security Post for a Visitor Pass.

  

2\. Proceed to the General Office to inform our counter staff that you are here to pick up your child/ward.

  

3\. Before leaving the General Office, please ensure you collect the “**Pink Slip**” from our counter staff and submit it to our Security Officer when you sign out at the Security Post and return the Visitor Pass. The “**Pink Slip**” is a record for your child/ward to leave the school during school operating hours. Our Security Officer will allow your child/ward to leave with you upon your submission of the “**Pink Slip**”.

  

If you have any enquiries, please contact Mr. Ng Lik Yong, Operations Manager at 64547672 or email [ng\_lik\_yong@schools.gov.sg](mailto:ng_lik_yong@schools.gov.sg) .

  

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.
