<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>We’re excited to share the journey of Fathers@ATS, an initiative that’s
grown from a simple idea into a full-fledged volunteer group, now proudly
part of Ai Tong School’s Parent Support Group (PSG). Launched in partnership
with Singapore’s national Dads for Life movement, Fathers@ATS has evolved
to inspire and support our fathers in building strong, lasting bonds with
their children.</p>
<p>The Dads for Life movement, established in 2009 by the Centre for Fathering,
aims to engage and empower fathers to positively impact their children’s
lives—every step of the way. Following this vision, Fathers@ATS began as
a collaborative effort with dedicated dads from another school, who extended
their hands to help us start this meaningful initiative here at Ai Tong.</p>
<p>Since those early days, Fathers@ATS has become an integral part of our
school community. Today, we organize regular events that foster father-child
bonding, promote relationship-building, and encourage meaningful involvement
in school life. This movement has grown alongside Ai Tong School, shaping
countless memorable experiences for fathers and students alike.</p>
<p>We hope to continue strengthening this community of supportive, active
fathers as we work together to create lasting memories for our children
and enrich their school experiences.</p>
