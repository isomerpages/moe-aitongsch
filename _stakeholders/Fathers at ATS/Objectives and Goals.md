<h3>What is Fathers@ATS?</h3>
<p>Fathers@ATS is a community of dedicated volunteer dads at Ai Tong School,
inspired by the values of the Dads4Life movement. We’re part of the school’s
Parent Support Group (PSG), focused on bringing fathers and their children
closer together through meaningful, school-based activities. Our mission
is simple: to help fathers build stronger, lasting bonds with their kids
while creating a supportive community of like-minded dads.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We organize a variety of events designed to inspire active, positive fatherhood,
encouraging dads to engage deeply in their children’s lives and become
the role models their kids need. Fathers@ATS is about shared experiences,
connection, and the joy of being present for every milestone.</p>
<h3>Our Goal</h3>
<p>Fathers@ATS aims to empower and support fathers in building strong, positive
relationships with their children. Aligned with the values of Dads4Life,
our program encourages meaningful father-child bonding through activities
and community engagement, fostering a nurturing environment where each
father can focus on their child, one moment at a time.</p>
