### The intended organization structure can be depicted by the following model:


**<u>Core Group</u>**

The Fathers@ATS group will consist of a core group of father-volunteers - current core members are:
1. Mr. Kong Hee Chua (Vinson)
2. Mr. Jason Lim
3. Mr. Muhammad Khairuldin Amran
4. Mr. Lai Shu Hau   

**<u>Regular Participating Group</u>**      
The eventual goal is to be able to establish a stable membership base for the Fathers@ATS group that will be able to create the network, support and participation of activities or campaigns from the group.

**<u>Extended Volunteer Group</u>**      
The role of the extended volunteer group is to support the core group in running activities for the Fathers@ATS group. This can range from organizing specific activities or campaigns on behalf of the group, to supplying manpower for running activities or campaigns.   

**<u>School Representative</u>**    
Besides the three groups defined within the organization structure, the following are the school liaison officers of the Fathers@ATS group.

1\. Ai Tong School     
* Mr Daniel Yak (Vice-Principal)     
* Mr Vincent Low  (P5/P6 Year Head)     

The school plays an integral part in supporting and providing resources in support of Fathers@ATS in achieving the vision of the group and making the experience of the children in ATS a more holistic and fulfilling one.  
  

2\.    Fathers of ATS children Part of the Regular    
Participating Group, and inclusive of other fathers who do not form the regular membership base, fathers are the primary target demographics of the school for which Fathers@ATS is created for.  

 3\.    Children of ATS  
The objectives of the school and Fathers@ATS is to create a holistic life for the children of ATS, in educating and providing a happy environment for the children to grow and succeed in, through the involvement of fathers in their lives as a positive influence.  
  

4\.    Dads for Life movement   
External national level organization set up to support fathers in their childrens’ lives, and an external support resource for the Fathers@ATS group in expertise and facilitation.  

 5\.    Parents Support Group  
The PSG in ATS is the other parent organization set up to run activities involving parents in the school. The PSG can provide support (and vice versa) to the Fathers@ATS group as a complementary group.  

 6\.   Ai Tong School Alumni  
The alumni organization in ATS is another organisation within the school that can provide support (and vice versa) to the Fathers@ATS group as a complementary group.  

**<u>Culture</u>**   
We seek to create a culture of inclusiveness that creates a bond between fathers. The environment for this group should be semi-formal, with some structure and organization around the group, however with less formality in method of engagement and a platform for social interaction. The group strives to create a strong network between fathers such that this can be a platform for support and network between fathers in ATS.
