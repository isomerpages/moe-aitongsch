    <td class="tg-x5q1">The Ai Tong School Alumni Association was founded on 10th October 1924. Throughout the history of the association, the Old Boys and Girls witnessed numerous closures and reinstatement of the association. In 1985, the alumni association finally took root and was officially formed. Since then, the alumni association has worked hand in hand with the school to organise activities and events such as the Chinese New Year Celebrations, the Mid-Autumn Festival and the School Founderâ€™s Day and many more.</td>
