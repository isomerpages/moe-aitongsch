### Being a PSG Member

**Being A PSG Member**

The Parent Support Group (PSG) is a great opportunity for parents to be closer to their children, understand them better, and help them in their education journey. Children also benefit when their parents are more active in their school environment.

The PSG complements the school by aligning with the school’s objectives, supporting and strengthening the school’s programmes to improve students’ well-being and learning.

Parents who are actively involved in the PSG are better able to reach out to other parents and involve them. Over time, more parents can contribute to make the school environment more conducive for learning.

### Our Mission

To support the school’s effort in creating a conducive learning environment through fostering close relationships with the school leaders, teachers, parents and students.
