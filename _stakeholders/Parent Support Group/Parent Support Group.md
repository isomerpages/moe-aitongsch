<h3>Being a PSG Member</h3>
<p><strong>Being A PSG Member</strong>
</p>
<p>The Parent Support Group (PSG) is a great opportunity for parents to be
closer to their children, understand them better, and help them in their
education journey. Children also benefit when their parents are more active
in their school environment.</p>
<p>The PSG complements the school by aligning with the schoolâ€™s objectives,
supporting and strengthening the schoolâ€™s programmes to improve studentsâ€™
well-being and learning.</p>
<p>Parents who are actively involved in the PSG are better able to reach
out to other parents and involve them. Over time, more parents can contribute
to make the school environment more conducive for learning.</p>
<h3>Our Mission</h3>
<p>To support the schoolâ€™s effort in creating a conducive learning environment
through fostering close relationships with the school leaders, teachers,
parents and students.</p>
