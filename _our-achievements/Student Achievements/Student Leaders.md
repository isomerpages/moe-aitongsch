<p><strong><u>Friends of SINGA 2023</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The Friend of Singa (FOS) programme began in 1990 to cultivate desirable
behaviours and values in students. FOS seeks to empower students to become
Kindness Ambassadors and to encourage all students to contribute beyond
themselves for the betterment of their surroundings (school, family, and
community).</p>
<p>36 student leaders from the Student Leader Council Exco Group (2022-2023)
had participated at the Friends of SINGA 2023 by leading a 4-week campaign
called The ATS Diversity Journey at Ai Tong School. The objective of this
campaign was to empower students to embrace diversity, fostering a culture
of inclusivity and appreciation for different cultures and races.</p>
