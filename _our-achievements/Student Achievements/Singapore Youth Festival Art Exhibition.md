<p>The Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) is an event organised by the Ministry
of Education to&nbsp;celebrate the vitality and talents of our youth in
the arts.&nbsp;The theme for this year is ‘Artist&nbsp;and Technology’.
It aims to highlight the artist’s role in utilising technology (past, present&nbsp;and
future) to explore and express their views about how technology has shaped
our lives.</p>
<p>We have achieved&nbsp;<strong>CERTIFICATE OF RECOGNITION</strong>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<strong>Category B</strong>&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;<strong>Category C</strong>.</p>
