<h3>Junior Science Whiz Challenge</h3>
<p>The Junior Science Whiz Challenge (JSWC) is jointly organised by West
Zone Centre of Excellence and Technology (WZCOE) @ River Valley High School
and RV Science Leaders Academy. JSWC is a competition that aims to develop
primary school students’ passion and interest in science. Participants
are tested on general science knowledge, including those beyond the Primary
School Science curriculum.</p>
<p>JSWC is guided by different themes every year. It seeks to allow participants
to explore the science behind the daily phenomena and real-life applications
that shaped our modern world, especially in the areas of Chemistry, Biology
and Physics. Participants get to appreciate the applications of science
today as well as its potential. JSWC aims to help participants further
their interest in various scientific disciplines.</p>
